# ADAS Perception Sensor Fusion

This repository contains a C++20–based ADAS perception pipeline built to explore system structure, software integration, and incremental development, rather than advanced perception algorithms. The project reflects how complex automotive software is typically developed: starting with a stable executable, defining clear data boundaries, and expanding functionality in controlled steps.


## Features (Planned)
 1. Simulated camera and lidar input  
 2. C++20 ImageFrame and LidarFrame classes  
 3. Timestamp synchronization  
 4. Basic perception and detection algorithms  
 5. Visualization and performance analysis  
 6. Automated scenario-based testing

## Tools & Technologies
- C++20, CMake
- Python (tooling and simulation)
- STL, concurrency
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- (Later: OpenCV / PCL optional)
