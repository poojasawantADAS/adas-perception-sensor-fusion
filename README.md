# ADAS Perception Sensor Fusion

This repository contains a real-time multi-sensor perception and fusion pipeline for ADAS systems using C++20 and Python. The project simulates camera and lidar data streams, performs synchronous data processing, and demonstrates foundational perception capabilities used in autonomous and intelligent vehicles.

## Features (Planned)
 1. Simulated camera and lidar input  
 2. C++20 ImageFrame and LidarFrame classes  
 3. Timestamp synchronization  
 4. Basic perception and detection algorithms  
 5. Visualization and performance analysis  
 6. Automated scenario-based testing

## Tools & Technologies
- C++20, CMake
- Python (tooling and simulation)
- STL, concurrency
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- (Later: OpenCV / PCL optional)

## Milestones
- Day 1: Project setup + ImageFrame class 🔄
- Day 2+: Lidar simulation, thread-safe pipelines, unit tests
